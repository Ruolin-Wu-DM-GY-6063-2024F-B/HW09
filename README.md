# HW09 Template

For 2024F 6063B [HW09](https://6063b.github.io/homework/09/#/programming)

For HW09A, I used a background picture behind and test whether the value of red is lower than the yellow and blue, also within the capacity.

(But I don't know why we use the oimg and img though hahaha, just for reference?)

For HW09B, I tried to use the facemesh we learned at class and then use the middle dot to generate the picture that I want to put the mask picture, but it did not work.

And ChatGPT recommand me to use all the keypoint, which can work.

Also, I'm sorry for the late submit ;-;.
